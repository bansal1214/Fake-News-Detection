# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection Analysis Classification

## Dataset Information
Develop a Deep learning program to identify when an article might be fake news.

### Problem Statement
Throughout the day in our daily routine we get number of news through several differnt mediums sometimes its difficult to decide which news is fake and which is authentic. Our job is to create a model to predict wether given news is real or fake

 ## Project Flow
1. Data Gathering
2. Data Preprocessing : Here we perform some operation on data A. Tokenization B. Lower Case C. Stopwords D. Lemmatization / Stemming
3. Vectorization (Convert Text data into the Vector)
4. Model Building : A. Model Object Initialization B. Train and Test Model
5. Model Evaluation : A. Accuracy Score B. Confusition Matrix C. Classification Report
6. Prediction on Test Data

### Tech Stack Used
1. Python
2. NLP
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
